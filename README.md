# MicroPostR - A Simple Microservices-Based App

MicroPostR is a small toy app designed to help me work with microservices at a simple scale. Although this app doesn't necessarily require microservices, it serves as a valuable tool for me to gain a better understanding of the tradeoffs involved.

In addition to building the app, I am documenting my findings and learnings as an exercise to solidify my understanding of the concepts. You can find the documentation in the [FINDINGS.md](./LEARNING.md) file.
